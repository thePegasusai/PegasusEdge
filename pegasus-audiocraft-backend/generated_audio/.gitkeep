# This file is intentionally left blank.
# It's used to ensure that the 'generated_audio' directory is tracked by Git,
# even if it's empty initially. Audio files generated by the application
# will be placed in this directory, but they are typically ignored by Git
# (e.g., via a .gitignore rule like 'generated_audio/*.wav') to avoid
# committing large binary files to the repository.
#
# If you have a .gitignore rule that ignores the contents of this directory
# (e.g., generated_audio/*), adding this .gitkeep file ensures that the
# directory itself still exists in the repository structure when cloned.
# This is helpful because the application expects this directory to exist
# at runtime to save the generated audio files.
#
# You can remove this file if you have other means of ensuring the directory
# is created before the application runs, or if you intend to commit
# some files within this directory.
